<!-- late release will contain a changelog
  A complete and
  detailed list of changes can be found in <a href="changelog.html">the
  change log page</a>.<br> -->
</p>
<h3>Differences Between Release 1.0 and Release 2.0</h3>
<p>
This release of the product includes many important changes for both store
administrators and developers. This section briefly highlights those
changes. For a complete listing of all the changes made to Oracle NoSQL
Database for this release (including all bug fixes) see the
<a href="changelog.html">change log</a>.
</p>
<p>
    This release of Oracle NoSQL Database comes in two distributions:
    Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE). The CE version is
    open source. It ships with source code and is released under the Affero
    General Public License (aGPL v3).
</p>
<p>
    The EE version does not include source code and it ships with an Oracle
    license. The EE version also includes two features not found in the CE
    version: SNMP support for monitoring the store, and Oracle External
    Tables support.
</p>


<p>
<i>System administrators</i> need to be aware of the following changes to the
product:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Where in Release 1.0 the term 'replication group' was used, now
            the term 'shard' is used.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The size of the store can now grow. In the previous release,
            the resources available to the store were fixed at installation
            time.  In this release, new Storage Nodes can be added to the
            store.
         </p>
         <p>
            The act of adding new Storage Nodes to your store, and then
            growing it so that Replication Nodes are added, is considered a
            part of store topology management.
         </p>
         <p>
            For more information, see
	    <a href="AdminGuide/managing-topology.html">Determining
	      your Store's Configuration</a>.
         </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            This release of the product adds the ability to monitor the
            store using either the Simple Network Management Protocol
            (SNMP) or the Java Management Extensions (JMX). For information
            on how to enable monitoring using these interfaces, see
            <a href="AdminGuide/standardized-monitoring.html">
                Standardized Monitoring Interfaces
            </a> in the <i>Oracle NoSQL Database Administrator's Guide</i>.
            For information on what you can monitor using JMX, see
            the
            <a href="javadoc/oracle/kv/mgmt/jmx/package-summary.html">
                oracle.kv.mgmt.jmx package</a>.
            For information on what you can monitor using SNMP, see
            the <a href="../lib/nosql.mib">nosql.mib</a> file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that SNMP support can only be found in the EE
            distribution.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            In Release 1.0, it was possible to use the Admin Console (an
            HTML-based graphical user interface) to configure the store.
            With this release of the product, you can only use the Admin
            Console to monitor the store. Now, you use the command line
            interface exclusively to administer and configure the store.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The Command Line Interface used to configure and monitor the
            store has changed, resulting in a large number of syntactical
            changes to CLI commands. Any CLI scripts written for Oracle
            NoSQL Database Release 1 will therefore have to be revised
            before they can be used with this release of the product.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            It was strongly recommended for Oracle NoSQL Database Release 1
            that Storage Nodes be configured with one and only Replication
            Nodes. This was because the physical characteristics of the
            Storage Node were not factored into decisions about store
            layout. In Release 2, Storage Node characteristics and shard
            availability are used to guide store layout. Consequently, a
            single Storage Node can now effectively host multiple
            Replication Nodes if it has sufficient resources.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            This release adds support for the Avro data format. The usage
            of this format is mostly of concern to developers, however Avro
            support requires that Avro schema (which is specified using
            JSON) be added and maintained in the store. While the writing
            of the Avro schemas should by performed by a development team,
            the management of the schema in the store is of concern to the
            store administrator.
        </p>
        <p>
            For information on how to add and manage schema in the store,
            see <a href="AdminGuide/provideschema.html">Managing Avro Schema</a> in the
            <i>Oracle NoSQL Database Administrator's Guide</i>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            This release adds support for Oracle external tables, which allows
            data contained in the NoSQL store to be read into Oracle
            Database. This is a read-only mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
            See the
            <a href="javadoc/oracle/kv/exttab/package-summary.html">
                oracle.kv.exttab package summary</a>
            for more information.
         </p>
        <p>
            Note that external tables support can only be found in the EE
            distribution.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            This release provides version 3 of the Admin and version 2 of
            the Replication Node components. This results in on-disk format
            changes which affect internal data stored by these components.
            The changes are forward compatible in that new version
            components can read data created by old version components, but
            old version components cannot read data created by new
            components. Because of this, after upgrade to Release 2, the
            system administrator cannot revert the store to Release 1.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>Developers</i> need to be aware of the following changes to the
product:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            This release adds support for the Avro data format. In Release
            1.0, developers were responsible for the serialization
            mechanism used to place data in the value portion of a store's
            record. Now, you can use Avro to perform this function, which
            provides an extremely compact, schema-based binary data format.
            The usage of Avro requires you to define a schema (using JSON)
            for the data contained in a record's value.
        </p>
        <p>
            To support planned future features of the product, it is
            <i>strongly</i> recommended to use the Avro data format
            wherever possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            For information on creating Avro schemas, see Chapter 7 in the
            <i>Getting Started Guide</i>,
            <a href="GettingStartedGuide/avroschemas.html">Avro Schemas</a>.
            For information on serializing/deserializing values that use
            the Avro data format, see Chapter 8 in the <i>Getting Started
                Guide</i>,
            <a href="GettingStartedGuide/avrobindings.html">Avro Bindings</a>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The Avro support provided in this release also brings with it
            a JSON binding for storing schema-based JSON data. This is of
            interest to developers who want to integrate Oracle NoSQL
            Database with existing JSON-based data sources and systems.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            This release adds support for large objects. Large object (LOB)
            support allows you to stream data directly to and from
            the store without materializing the data. This is useful for
            situations where the size of data items might threaten to
            disrupt your Java Virtual Machine's Garbage Collection
            performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            LOB support requires you to use a specific API for
            reading/writing/deleting records in the store. It also requires
            you to identify LOB records using keys with a specific suffix.
        </p>
        <p>
            For more information on LOB support, see
            <a href="GettingStartedGuide/lob.html">Using Large Objects</a>
            in the Oracle NoSQL Database Getting Started Guide.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            This release provides a C API for developing NoSQL DB clients.
            The C API makes use of the Java Native Interface, and as such
            requires the presence of a Java Virtual Machine in order to
            run.
        </p>
        <p>
            The C API is described in the
            <i>Oracle NoSQL Database C API Reference Guide</i> which is available as a separate download.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            This release adds support for Oracle external tables, which allows
            data contained in the NoSQL store to be read into Oracle
            Database. This is a read-only mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
            See the
            <a href="javadoc/oracle/kv/exttab/package-summary.html">
                oracle.kv.exttab package summary
            </a> for more information.
         </p>
        <p>
            Note that external tables support can only be found in the EE
            distribution.
        </p>
