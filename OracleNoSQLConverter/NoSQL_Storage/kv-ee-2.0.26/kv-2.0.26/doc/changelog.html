<h2 align="center">Oracle NoSQL Database Change Log
</h2>
<p align="center">Release 11gR2.2.0.26 Enterprise Edition</p>

Oracle NoSQL Database 2.0 has moved to Admin version 2. This is an on-disk
format change which affects internal data stored by the Admin services. The
change is forward compatible in that Admin services deployed using 2.0 can read
data created by older releases. The change is not backwards compatible in that
Admin services which have been deployed with the new release cannot be
restarted using older NoSQL releases.
<p>
See the section
on <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/NOSQL/html/AdminGuide/deploymentupdate.html">
Updating an Existing Oracle NoSQL Database Deployment</a> in the Admin
Guide.

<!-- ========================================================= -->
<h3><a name="Features">New Features:</a></h3>
<ol>

<li>
This release adds the capability to remove an Admin service replica.
If you have deployed more than one Admin, you can remove one of them
using the following command:
<blockquote>
<pre>
plan remove-admin -admin &lt;adminId&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
You cannot remove the sole Admin if only one Admin instance is
configured.
</p><p>
For availability and durability reasons, it is highly recommended that
you maintain at least three Admin instances at all times.  For that
reason, if you try to remove an Admin when the removal would result in
there being fewer than three, the command will fail unless you give
the <i>-force</i> flag.
</p><p>
If you try to remove the Admin that is currently the master,
mastership will transfer to another Admin.  The plan will be
interrupted, and subsequently can be re-executed on the new master
Admin.  To re-execute the interrupted plan, you would use this command:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
plan execute -id &lt;planId&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
</li><br>

<li>
The Admin CLI verify has an added check to verify that the Replication
Nodes hosted on a single Storage Node have memory settings that fit
within the Storage Node's memory budget. This guards against mistakes
that may occur if the system adminstrator overrides defaults and
manually sets Replication Node heap sizes.[#21727]
</li><br>

<li>
The Admin CLI verify command now labels any verification issues as
violations or notes. Violations are of greater importance, and the
system administrator should determine how to adjust the system to
address the problem. Notes are warnings, and are of lesser
importance. [#21950]
</li><br>

</ol>

<h3><a name="BugFixes">Bug fixes:</a></h3>
<!-- ========================================================= -->
<ol>

<li>
Several corrections were made to latency statistics. These corrections apply
to the service-side statistics in the Admin console, CLI <code>show perf</code>
command, .perf files and .csv files, as well as the client-side statistics
returned by KVStore.getStats. However, corrections to the 95% and 99% values do
not apply to the client-side statistics, since these values do not appear in
the client-side API.
  <ul>
      <li>The definition of latency has been corrected for the "multi"
      operation requests (multiGet, multiDelete, execute, etc).  These are
      labeled "multi" in the <code>Op Type</code> column where latency
      information is displayed.  The previous definition was "latency in
      milliseconds per <em>operation</em>" while the new definition is "latency
      in milliseconds per <em>request</em>".  In other words, for a "multi"
      operation request, latency now applies to the entire request rather than
      to each operation.  For "single" operation requests, the definition of
      latency has not changed.
      </li>
      <li>To go along with the change above, a new column containing the number
      of requests in the sample has been added to all latency information
      displays: <code>TotalReq</code>.  This is also available for client-side
      statictics using the new <code>OperationMetrics.getTotalRequests</code>
      method.  For "multi" operation requests, the total number of requests is
      normally smaller than the total number of operations (the
      <code>TotalOps</code> column).  For "single" operation requests, the
      total number of requests and operations are equal.
      </li>
      <li>Improved the consistency of the values reported in each sample so
      that, for example, the minimum latency is always less than the maximum
      latency.  However, note that statistics are collected without
      synchronization to avoid impacting performance, and for small sample
      sizes the values in a sample are not always accurate or self-consistent.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed a bug that caused the 95% and 99% values to show the maximum
      latency recorded (within 1000 ms), rather than the lowest 95% or 99% as
      intended.  This bug only applied to the "multi" operation requests.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed a bug that caused the 95% and 99% values to sometimes
      mistakenly appear as -1.  These values should only appear as -1 when
      there were no operations in the sample with a latency below 1000 ms.
      </li>
  </ul>
[#21763]
</li><br>

<li>
Modified the Administration Process to allocate ports from within a port range
if one is specified by the <i>-servicerange</i> argument to
the <i>makebootconfig</i> utility. If the argument is not specified the
Administration Process will use any available port. Please see
the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/NOSQL/html/AdminGuide/"> Admin Guide</a>
for details regarding the configuration of ports used by Oracle NoSQL
Database.  [#21962]
</li><br>

<li>
Modified the replication node to handle the unlikely case that the locally
stored topology is missing. A missing topology results in a
java.lang.NullPointerException being thrown in the TopologyManager and will
prevent the replication node from starting. [#22015]
</li><br>

<li>
Replication Node memory calculations are more robust for Storage Nodes
that host multiple Replication Nodes. In previous releases, using the
plan change-params command to reduce the capacity parameter for a
Storage Node which hosts multiple Replication Nodes could result in an
over aggressive increase in RN heap, which would make the Replication
Nodes fail at startup. The problem would be fixed when a topology was
rebalanced, but until that time, the Replication Nodes were
unavailable. The default memory sizing calculation now factors in the
number of RNs resident on a Storage Node, and adjusts RN heap sizes as
Replication Nodes are relocated by the deploy-topology
command. [#21942]
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that could cause a NullPointerException, such as the one below,
during RN start-up.  The exception would appear in the RN log and the RN would
fail to start.  The conditions under which this problem occurred include
partition migration between shards along with multiple abnormal RN shutdowns.
If this bug is encountered, it can be corrected by upgrading to the current
release, and no data loss will occur.

[#22052]
</li><br>

<li>
Fixed a bug that causes excess memory to be used in the storage engine cache on
an RN, which could result in poor performance as a result of cache eviction and
additional I/O.  The problem occurred only when the
<code>KVStore.storeIterator</code> or <code>KVStore.storeKeysIterator</code>
method was used.  [#21973]
</li><br>

</ol>

<!-- ========================================================= -->
<h3><a name="General">Performance and other General Changes:</a></h3>
<!-- ========================================================= -->
<ol>

<li>
The replicas in a shard now dynamically configure the JE property 
<i>RepParams.REPLAY_MAX_OPEN_DB_HANDLES</i> which controls the size of the cache
used to hold database handles during replication. The cache size is determined
dynamically based upon the number of partitions currently hosted by the
shard. This improved cache sizing can result in better write performance for
shards hosting large numbers of partitions. [#21967]
</li><br>

<li>
The names of the client and server JAR files no longer include release
version numbers.  The files are now called:
<blockquote>
<pre>
lib/kvstore.jar
lib/kvclient.jar
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This change should reduce the amount of work needed to switch to a new
release because the names of JAR files will no longer change between
releases.  Note that the name of the installation directory continues to
include the release version number. [#22034]
</li><br>

<li>
A SEVERE level message is now logged and an admin alert is fired when the
storage engine's average log cleaner (disk reclamation) backlog increases over
time.  An example of the message text is below.
<pre>
121215 13:48:57:480 SEVERE [...] Average cleaner backlog has grown from 0.0 to
6.4. If the cleaner continues to be unable to make progress, the JE cache size
and/or number of cleaner threads are probably too small. If this is not
corrected, eventually all available disk space will be used.
</pre>
For more information on setting the cache size appropriately to avoid such
problems, see "Determining the Per-Node Cache Size" in the Administrator's
Guide.
[#21111]
</li><br>

<li>
The storage engine's log cleaner will now delete files in the latter portion of
the log, even when the application is not performing any write operations.
Previously, files were prohibited from being deleted in the portion of the log
after the last application write.  When a log cleaner backlog was present (for
example, when the cache had been configured too small, relative to the data set
size and write rate), this could cause the cleaner to operate continuously
without being able to delete files or make forward progress.  [#21069]
</li><br>

<li>
NoSQL DB 2.0.23 introduced a performance regression over R1.2.23. The 
kvstore client library and Replication Node consumed a greater
percentage of system cpu time. This regression has been fixed. [#22096]
</li><br>
</ol>

<h3 align="center"><u>Changes in 11gR2.2.0.23</u></h3>

<!-- ========================================================= -->
<h3><a name="Features">New Features:</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
This release provides the ability to add storage nodes to the system
after it has been deployed. The system will rebalance and redistribute
the data onto the new nodes without stopping operations. See Chapter
6, of the Admin
Guide, <a href="AdminGuide/managing-topology.html">Determining
your Store's Configuration</a>, for more details.
<li>
A new <code>oracle.kv.lob</code> package provides operations that can
be used to read and write Large Objects (LOBs) such as audio and video
files. As a general rule, any object larger than 1 MB is a good
candidate for representation as a LOB. The LOB API permits access to
large values without having to materialize the value in its entirety
by providing streaming APIs for reading and writing these objects.
<li>
A C API has been added. The implementation uses Java JNI and requires
a Java virtual machine to run on the client. It is available as a
separate download.
<li>
Added a new remove-storagenode plan. This command will
remove a storage node which is not hosting any NoSQL Database components
from the system's topology. Two examples of when this might be useful
are:
<blockquote>
A storage node was incorrectly configured, and cannot be deployed.<br>
A storage node was once part of a NoSQL Database, but all components have
been migrated from it using the migrate-storagenode command, and the
storage node should be decommissioned.
</blockquote>
[#20530]
</li>
<li>
Added the ability to specify additional physical configuration
information about storage nodes including:
<ul>
  <li>Capacity - the number of RepNodes the SN may host</li>
  <li>Number of CPUs</li>
  <li>Amount of memory to use</li>
  <li>Specific directory paths (mount points) to use for RepNodes</li>
</ul>
This information is used by the system to make more intelligent
choices about resource allocation and consumption.  The administration
documentation discusses how these parameters are set and used.
[#20951]
</li>
<li>Added Avro support.  The value of a kv pair can now be stored in Avro
binary format.  An Avro schema is defined for each type of data stored.  The
Avro schema is used to efficiently and compactly serialize the data, to
guarantee that the data conforms to the schema, and to perform automatic
evolution of the data as the schema changes over time.  Bindings are supplied
that allow representing Avro data as a POJO (Plain Old Java Object), a JSON
object, or a generic Map-like data structure. For more information, see
<a href="GettingStartedGuide/avroschemas.html">Chapter 7 - Avro Schemas</a> and
<a href="GettingStartedGuide/avrobindings.html">Chapter 8 - Avro Bindings</a>
in the <i>Getting Started Guide</i>. The <code>oracle.kv.avro</code> package is
described in the Javadoc.  The use of the Avro format is strongly
recommended.  NoSQL DB will leverage Avro in the future to provide additional
features and capabilities.  [#21213]
</li>
<li>Added Avro support for the Hadoop <code>KVInputFormat</code> classes.
A new <code>oracle.kv.hadoop.KVAvroInputFormat</code> class returns Avro
<code>IndexedRecord</code>s to the caller. When this class is  used in
conjunction with Oracle Loader for Hadoop, it is possible to read data
directly from NoSQL Database using OLH without using an interim Map-Reduce
job to store data in HDFS. [#21157]
</li>
<li>Added a feature which allows Oracle Database External Tables to be
used to access Oracle NoSQL Database records. There is more
information in javadoc for the
<a href="javadoc/index.html?oracle/kv/exttab/package-summary.html">
<code>oracle.kv.exttab</code></a> package and an "cookbook" example in the
<a href="examples/index.html?externaltables/package-summary.html">

<ol>
<li>
The following new methods:
<ul>
<li><code>KVStoreConfig.setOpenTimeout()</code></li>
<li><code>KVStoreConfig.getOpenTimeout()</code></li>
<li><code>KVStoreConfig.setReadTimeout()</code></li>
<li><code>KVStoreConfig.getReadTimeout()</code></li>
</ul>
have been added to allow clients to configure the socket timeouts used to make
client requests. Please review the javadoc for details.
<p>
R1 installations must ensure that the software on the storage nodes has
been upgraded as described in the upgrade documentation
accompanying this release before using the above APIs on the client.
[#20997]
</li>

<li>
New service parameters have been added to control the backlog
associated with sockets created by NoSQL Database. These are
controllable for the Rep Node and Storage Nodes' Monitor, Admin, and
Registry Handler interfaces. The parameters
are <code>rnRHSOBacklog</code> (default
1024), <code>rnMonitorSOBacklog</code> (default 0), rnAdminSOBacklog
(default 0), <code>rnAdminSOBacklog</code> (default 0),
<code>snAdminSOBacklog</code> (default
0), <code>snMonitorSOBacklog</code> (default 0), and
<code>snRegistrySOBacklog</code> (default 1024).
[#21322]
</li>

<li>
  Previously, calling <code>Key.isPrefix</code> with an argument containing
  a smaller major or minor path than the target Key object caused an
  IndexOutOfBoundsException in certain cases.  This has been fixed.
</li>
<li>
The <code>KeyRange()</code> constructor now checks that the start
<code>Key</code> is less than the end <code>Key</code> if both are specified,
otherwise an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> is thrown.
<code>KeyRange</code> also has <code>toString()</code> and
<code>fromString()</code> methods for encoding and decoding
<code>KeyRange</code> instances, similar to the same methods in
<code>Key</code>. [#21470]
</li>
</ol>
<!-- ========================================================= -->
<h3><a name="Utilities">Utility Changes:</a></h3>
<!-- ========================================================= -->
<ol>
<li>
Many new commands have been added to the CLI. See
<a href="AdminGuide/cli_command_reference.html">
    Appendix A - Command Line Interface (CLI) Command Reference
</a> of the <i>Administrator's Guide</i>
for details.
<li>
The Admin Console is now for monitoring only.
<li>
Administration CLI commands have been changed so that component ids
match the ids used in the topology display. Previously Datacenters,
Storage Nodes, Admin instances and Replication Nodes were identified
only by number. For example, the syntax to add Storage Node 17 to a
Storage Node pool, or to show the parameters for a given Replication Node was:
<blockquote>
<pre>
joinPool myStorageNodePool 17
show repnode-params 5,3
</pre>
</blockquote>
Datacenters can now be expressed as # or dc#<br>
Admin instances can now be expressed as # or admin#<br>
Storage Nodes can now be expressed as # or sn#<br>
Replication Nodes can now be expressed as groupNum,nodeNum, or rgX-rnY<br>
<p>
The commands shown above are still valid, but can also be expressed as:
<blockquote>
<pre>
joinPool myStorageNodePool sn17
show repnode-params rg5-rn3
</pre>
</blockquote>

<li>
 The javadoc for the <code>Key.createKey</code> methods has been improved to
 warn that List instances passed as parameters are owned by the Key object
 after calling the method.  To avoid unpredictable results, they must not be
 modified.  [#20530]

<ol>
<li>
  Previously, executing a change-repnode-params plan in order to
  change Replication Node parameters for a node other than the one
  running the Admin service would fail. This operation will now
  succeed. [#20901]
</li><br>
<li>
  A deploy-storage-node plan which ran into problems when attempting
  to deploy a new storage node would leave the problematic SN in the
  store. This would require that the user either take manual action to
  remove the bad SN, or fix the problem and retry the plan. For
  convenience, the deploy-storage-node plan will now clean up if it
  runs into errors, and will not leave the failed SN behind. [#20530]

<h3><a name="General">Performance and other General Changes:</a></h3>
<!-- ========================================================= -->

<li>
  The command line interface's <code>snapshot create</code> command
  has been made significantly faster. Previously, it could take

  should be reduced to seconds. [#20772]
</li>

</ol>

<!-- ========================================================= -->
<h3><a name="Utilities">Utility Changes:</a></h3>
<!-- ========================================================= -->
<ol>
<li>
The two scripts for starting kvlite and executing control commands,
<code>bin/run-kvlite.sh</code> and <code>bin/kvctl</code>, have been replaced
by a <code>java -jar lib/kvstore-M.N.P.jar</code> command.  This provides portability
to all Java platforms, including Windows.  The two scripts are deprecated, but
will be supported for at least one release cycle.
<p>
The translation from the old script commands to the new -jar commands is as
follows:</p>
<table border="1">
    <tr><th>Old script command</th><th>New -jar command</th></tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>bin/run-kvlite.sh args...</code></td>
        <td><code>java -jar lib/kvstore-M.N.P.jar kvlite args...</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>bin/kvctl command args...</code></td>
        <td><code>java -jar lib/kvstore-M.N.P.jar command args...</code></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
There are a few differences to be aware of between the old and new commands.
<ul>
    <li><p><code>nohup</code>, if desired, must be explicitly specified.  In
    the <code>bin/kvctl</code> script, nohup was added automatically for the
    <code>start</code> and <code>restart</code> commands.  To specify the
    equivalent command, use:</p>
    <p><code>nohup java -jar lib/kvstore-M.N.P.jar start args... &gt; /dev/null &lt;
    /dev/null 2&lt;&amp;1 &amp;</code></p>
    </li>
    <li><p>The logging configuration file for kvlite is now specified using
    standard Java syntax.  Previously, the
    <code>examples/logging.properties</code> configuration file was added
    automatically when passing <code>-logging</code> to the
    <code>run-kvlite.sh</code> script.  The new equivalent is:</p>
    <p><code>java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=examples/logging.properties
    -jar lib/kvstore-M.N.P.jar kvlite args...</code></p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Previously, the <code>-host</code> argument defaulted to
    the local machine name (via the <code>`hostname`</code> command) when
    running the <code>kvctl</code> script.  Now, for all control commands, no
    default hostname is used and the <code>-host</code> argument must be
    specified explicitly.  This change was made for two reasons: 1)
    consistency, since the port and other arguments have no default value for
    control commands, and 2) safety, since specifying an explicit hostname
    guards against accidental errors.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Previously, the <code>-host</code> argument defaulted to
    <code>localhost</code> when running the <code>run-kvlite.sh</code> script.
    Now, the default is the local machine name rather than (literally)
    <code>localhost</code>.  Note that the kvlite command, unlike the control
    commands, has default values for all arguments.  This is because the kvlite
    command is designed for ease-of-use during development on a single machine.
    kvlite should not be used in production or for performance testing.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Previously, running <code>java -jar lib/kvstore-M.N.P.jar</code>, with or
    without arguments, printed the product version.  Now, if no arguments are
    specified, a usage message is printed.  To print the version, use the
    version command:</p>
    <p><code>java -jar lib/kvstore-M.N.P.jar version</code></p>
    </li>
</ul>
</li></br>
