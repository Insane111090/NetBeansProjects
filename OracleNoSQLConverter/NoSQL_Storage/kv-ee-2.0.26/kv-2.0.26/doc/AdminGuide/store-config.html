          Now that you have some idea of your store's storage and
          performance requirements, you can decide how you should configure
          the store. To do this, you must decide: 
      </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
                  How many shards you should use.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  How many replication partitions you should use.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  What your Replication Factor should be.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                  Finally, how many nodes you should use in your store.
              </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
          The following sections cover these topics in greater detail.
      </p>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="num-rep-group"></a>Identify the Target Number of Shards</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
              The KVStore contains one or more shards. Each
              shard contains a single node that is responsible
              for servicing write requests, plus one or more nodes that are
              responsible for servicing read requests.
          </p>
        <p>
              The more shards your store contains, the
              better your store is at servicing write requests.
              Therefore, if your Oracle NoSQL Database application requires high
              throughput on data writes (that is, record creations,
              updates, and deletions) then you want to configure your store
              with more shards.
          </p>
        <p>
              Shards contain one or more partitions (described
              in the next section), and key-value pairs are spread evenly
              across these partitions. This means that the more shards your store
			  contains, the less disk space your store requires on a per-node basis.
          </p>
        <p>
              For example, suppose you know your store contains roughly
              <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> records, each of which represents
              a total of <span class="emphasis"><em>m</em></span> bytes of data, for a total
              of <span class="emphasis"><em>n * m</em></span> bytes of data to be
              managed by your store. If you have three shards,
              then each Storage Node must have enough disk space to contain
              <span class="emphasis"><em>(n * m) / 3</em></span> bytes of data.
          </p>
        <p>
              It might help you to use the following formula to arrive at
              a rough initial estimate of the number of shards that
              you need:
          </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">RG = (((((avg key size * 2) + avg value size) * max kv pairs) * 2) + 
      (avg key size * max kv pairs) / 100 ) / 
      (node storage capacity)</pre>
        <p>
                Note that the final factor of two in the first line of the
                equation is based upon a KVStore tuning control called the
                <span class="emphasis"><em>cleaner utilization</em></span>. Here, we assume
                you leave the cleaner utilization at 50%.
            </p>
        <p>
                As an example, a store sized to hold a maximum of 1 billion key
                value pairs, having an average key size of 10 bytes and an
                average value size of 1K, with 1TB (10^12)  of storage
                available at each node would require two shards:
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">((((10*2)+1000) * (10^9)) * 2) + ((10 * (10^9))/100) / 10^12 = 2 RGs</pre>
        <p>
                Remember that this formula only provides a rough estimate.
                Other factors such as I/O throughput and cache sizes need to
                be considered in order to arrive at a better approximation.
                Whatever number you arrive at here, you should thoroughly test 
                it in a pre-production environment, and then make any necessary 
                adjustments. (This is true of any estimate you make when planning 
                your Oracle NoSQL Database installation.)

        <p>
              Every shard in your store must contain at least
              one partition, but you should configure your store so that
              it contains many partitions. The records in the
              KVStore are spread evenly across the KVStore partitions, and
              as a consequence they are also spread evenly across your
              shards. You identify the total number of
              partitions that your store should contain when you initially
              create your store. This number is static and cannot be changed
			  over your store's lifetime.
          </p>
        <p>
              Make sure the number of partitions you select is more than
              the largest number of shards you ever expect your
              store to contain. It is possible to add shards to the store, and 
			  when you do, the store is re-balanced by moving partitions
			  between shards (and with them, the data that they contain). 
			  Therefore, the total number of partitions that you select
			  is actually a permanent limit on the total number of
              shards your store is able to contain.
          </p>
        <p>
              Note that there is some overhead in configuring an
              excessively large number of partitions. That said, it does no
              harm to select a partition value that gives you plenty of
              room for growing your store. It is not unreasonable to select
              a partition number that is 100 times the maximum number of
              shards that you ever expect to use with your
              store.

              The KVStore contains one or more shards. Each
              shard contains a single node that is responsible
              for servicing write requests (the master), plus one or more
              nodes that are responsible for servicing read requests (the
              replicas).
          </p>
        <p>
              The store's Replication Factor simply describes how many
              nodes (master + replicas) each shard contains.
              A Replication Factor of 3 gives you shards with one
              master plus two replicas. (Of course, if you lose or
              shut down a node that is hosting a master, then the
              master fails over to one of the other nodes in the
              shard, giving you a shard with one master and one
              replica. But this should be an unusual, and temporary,
              condition for your shards.)
          </p>
        <p>
              The bigger your Replication Factor, the more responsive your
              store can be at servicing read requests because there are
              more nodes per shard available to service those
              requests. However, a larger Replication Factor reduces the
              number of shards your store can have, assuming a
              static number of Storage Nodes.
          </p>
        <p>
              A large Replication Factor can also slow down your store's
              write performance, because each shard has more nodes to which
			  updates must be transferred.
          </p>
        <p>
              In general, we recommend a Replication Factor of 3, unless
              your performance testing suggests some other number works
              better for your particular workload.  Also, do not select a
              Replication Factor of 2 because doing so means that even a
              single failure results in too few sites to elect a new
              master. 
          </p>

        <p>
              You can estimate the total number of Storage Nodes needed for
              your store by multiplying the number of shards
              you require times your Replication Factor. This number should
              suffice, unless you discover that your hard disks are unable
              to deliver enough IOPs to meet your throughput requirements.
              In that case, you might need to increase your Replication
              Factor, or increase your total number of shards. 
          </p>
        <p>
              If you underestimate the number of Storage Nodes, remember that 
              it is possible to dynamically increase the number of Storage Nodes
              in use by the store. To use the command line interface to expand 
              your store, see

              Whatever estimates you arrive at, make sure to
              <span class="emphasis"><em>thoroughly</em></span> test your configuration
              before deploying your store into a production environment.
