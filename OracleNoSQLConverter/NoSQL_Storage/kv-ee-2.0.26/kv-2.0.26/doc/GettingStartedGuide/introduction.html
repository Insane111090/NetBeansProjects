        Welcome to Oracle NoSQL Database (Oracle NoSQL Database). Oracle NoSQL Database provides multi-terabyte
        distributed key/value pair storage that offers scalable throughput
        and performance.  That is, it services network requests to store
        and retrieve data which is organized into key-value pairs.  Oracle NoSQL Database
        services these types of data requests with a latency, throughput,
        and data consistency that is predictable based on how the store is
        configured.
    </p>
      <p>
        Oracle NoSQL Database offers full Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD)
        operations with adjustable durability guarantees.  Oracle NoSQL Database is
        designed to be highly available, with excellent throughput and
        latency, while requiring minimal administrative interaction. 
    </p>
      <p>
        Oracle NoSQL Database provides performance scalability. If you require better
        performance, you use more hardware. If your performance
        requirements are not very steep, you can purchase and manage fewer
        hardware resources. 
    </p>
      <p>
        Oracle NoSQL Database is meant for any application that requires
        network-accessible key-value data with user-definable read/write
        performance levels.  The typical application is a web application
        which is servicing requests across the traditional three-tier
        architecture: web server, application server, and back-end
        database. In this configuration, Oracle NoSQL Database is meant to be installed
        behind the application server, causing it to either take the place
        of the back-end database, or work alongside it. To make use of
        Oracle NoSQL Database, code must be written (using Java or C) that runs on the
        application server.
    </p>
      <p>
        An application makes use of Oracle NoSQL Database by performing network requests
        against Oracle NoSQL Database's key-value store, which is referred to as the
        KVStore.  The requests are made using the Oracle NoSQL Database Driver, which is
        linked into your application as a Java library (.jar file), and
        then accessed using a series of Java APIs. 
    </p>
      <p>
        By using the Oracle NoSQL Database APIs, the developer is able to perform create,
        read, update and delete operations on the data contained in the
        KVStore. The usage of these APIs is introduced later in this
        manual.

        <p>
            The KVStore is a collection of Storage Nodes which host a set
            of Replication Nodes.  Data is spread across the Replication
            Nodes. Given a traditional three-tier web architecture, the
            KVStore either takes the place of your back-end database, or
            runs alongside it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The store contains multiple Storage Nodes.  A 
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Storage Node</em></span> is a physical (or virtual)
            machine with its own local storage.  The machine is intended to
            be commodity hardware. It should be, but is not required to be,
            identical to all other Storage Nodes within the store.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following illustration depicts the typical architecture
            used by an application that makes use of Oracle NoSQL Database:
        </p>
        <div class="mediaobject">
          <img src="KVStoreArchitecture.jpg" alt="NoSQL Database Store Architecture" />
        </div>
        <p>
            Every Storage Node hosts one or more Replication Nodes, which
            in turn contain one or more partitions. 
            
            Also, each Storage Node contains monitoring software that
            ensures the Replication Nodes which it hosts are running and
            are otherwise healthy.

              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
                At a very high level, a 
                <span class="emphasis"><em>Replication Node</em></span> can be thought of as 
                a single database which contains key-value pairs. 
            </p>
          <p>
                Replication Nodes are organized into
                <span class="emphasis"><em>shards</em></span>. A shard contains a single
                Replication Node which is responsible for performing
                database writes, and which copies those writes to the other
                Replication Nodes in the shard. This is called the
                <span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span> node. All other Replication
                Nodes in the shard are used to service read-only
                operations. These are called the
                <span class="emphasis"><em>replicas</em></span>. Although there can be only
                one master node at any given time, any of the members of
                the shard are capable of becoming a master node. In other
                words, each shard uses a single master/multiple replica
                strategy to improve read throughput and availability.
            </p>
          <p>
                The following illustration shows how the KVStore is
                divided up into shards:
            </p>
          <div class="mediaobject">
            <img src="RepGroups.jpg" alt="NoSQL Database shards" />
          </div>
          <p>
                Note that if the machine hosting the master should fail in
                any way, then the master automatically fails over to one of
                the other nodes in the shard. (That is, one of the replica
                nodes is automatically promoted to master.)
            </p>
          <p>
                Production KVStores should contain multiple shards. At
                installation time you provide information that allows
                Oracle NoSQL Database to automatically decide how many shards the store
                should contain. The more shards that your store contains,
                the better your write performance is because the store
                contains more nodes that are responsible for servicing
                write requests.
            </p>
          <p>
                Note that while no performance tuning of the store is
                currently possible once it has been deployed, it is also
                true that how you set your consistency policies and
                durability guarantees affects the store's overall
                performance.  For more information, see
                <a class="xref" href="consistency.html" title="Chapter 11. Consistency Guarantees">Consistency Guarantees</a>
                and

          </div>
          <p>
                The number of nodes belonging to a shard is called its
                <span class="emphasis"><em>Replication Factor</em></span>. The larger a
                shard's Replication Factor, the faster its read throughput
                (because there are more machines to service the read
                requests) but the slower its write performance (because
                there are more machines to which writes must be copied).
                You set the Replication Factor for the store, and then
                Oracle NoSQL Database makes sure the appropriate number of Replication
                Nodes are created for each shard that your store contains.

          </div>
          <p>
                Each shard contains one or more
                <span class="emphasis"><em>partitions</em></span>.  Key-value pairs in the
                store are organized according to the key. Keys, in turn,
                are assigned to a partition. Once a key is placed in a
                partition, it cannot be moved to a different partition.
                Oracle NoSQL Database automatically assigns keys evenly across all the
                available partitions.
            </p>
          <p>
                As part of your planning activities, you must decide how
                many partitions your store should have. Note that this is
                not configurable after the store has been installed.
            </p>
          <p>
                It is possible to expand and change the number of Storage
                Nodes in use by the store. When this happens, the store can
                be reconfigured to take advantage of the new resources by
                adding new shards. When this happens, partitions are
                balanced between new and old shards by redistributing
                partitions from one shard to another. For this reason, it
                is desirable to have enough partitions so as to allow
                fine-grained reconfiguration of the store. Note that there
                is a minimal performance cost for having a large number of
                partitions. As a rough rule of thumb, there should be at
                least 10 to 20 partitions per shard. Since the number of
                partitions cannot be changed after the initial deployment,
                you should consider the maximum future size of the store
                when specifying the number of partitions.

                A <span class="emphasis"><em>topology</em></span> is the collection of
                storage nodes, replication nodes and administration
                services that make up an NoSQL DB store. A deployed store
                has one topology that describes its state at a given time. 
            </p>
          <p>
                Topologies can be changed to achieve different performance
                characteristics, or in reaction to changes in the number or
                characteristics of the Storage Nodes. Changing and
                deploying a topology is an iterative process.
