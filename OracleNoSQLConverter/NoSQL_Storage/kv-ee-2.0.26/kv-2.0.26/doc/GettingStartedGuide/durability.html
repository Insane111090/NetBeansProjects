      <p>
          Writes are performed in the KV store by performing the write
          operation (be it a creation, update, or delete operation) on a
          master node.  As a part of performing the write operation, the
          master node will usually make sure that the operation has made it
          to stable storage before considering the operation complete.
      </p>
      <p>
          The master node will also transmit the write operation
          to the replica nodes in its replication group. It is possible to
          ask the master node to wait for acknowledgments from its
          replicas before considering the operation complete.
      </p>
      <p>
          The replicas, in turn, will not acknowledge the write operation
          until they have applied the operation to their own database.
      </p>
      <p>
          The sum total of all this write activity is called the
          <span class="emphasis"><em>durability guarantee</em></span>. That is, a durability
          guarantee is a policy which describes how strongly persistent
          your data is in the event of some kind of catastrophic failure
          within the store.  (Examples of a catastrophic failure are power
          outages, disk crashes, physical memory corruption, or even fatal
          application programming errors.)
      </p>
      <p>
          A high durability guarantee means that there is a very high
          probability that the write operation will be retained in the
          event of a catastrophic failure within the store. A low
          durability guarantee means that the write is very unlikely to be
          retained in the event of a catastrophic failure.
      </p>
      <p>
          The higher your durability guarantee, the slower your
          write-throughput will be in the store. This is because a high
          durability guarantee requires a great deal of disk and network
          activity.
      </p>
      <p>
          Usually you want some kind of a durability guarantee, although if
          you have highly transient data that changes from run-time to
          run-time, you might want to set the durability guarantee for that
          data to the lowest possible level.
      </p>
      <p>
          Durability guarantees include two types of information:
          acknowledgment guarantees and synchronization guarantees. These
          two types of guarantees are described in the next sections. We
          then show how to set a durability guarantee.

        <p>
              Whenever a master node performs a write operation (create,
              update or delete), it must send that operation to its various
              replica nodes. The replica nodes then apply the write
              operation(s) to their local databases so that the replicas
              are consistent relative to the master node.
          </p>
        <p>
              Upon successfully applying write operations to their local
              databases, replicas send an <span class="emphasis"><em>acknowledgment
              message</em></span> back to the master node. This message
              simply says that the write operation was received and
              successfully applied to the replica's local database.
          </p>
        <p>
              An acknowledgment-based durability policy describes whether
              the master node will wait for these acknowledgments before
              considering the write operation to have completed
              successfully. You can require the master node to wait for no
              acknowledgments, acknowledgments from a simple majority of
              replica nodes, or acknowledgments from all replica nodes.
          </p>
        <p>
              The more acknowledgments the master requires, the slower its
              write performance will be. Waiting for acknowledgments means
              waiting for a write message to travel from the master to
              the replicas, then for the write operation to be performed at
              the replica (this may mean disk I/O), then for an
              acknowledgment message to travel from the replica back to
              the master. From a computer application's point of view, this
              can all take a long time.
          </p>
        <p>
              When setting an acknowledgment-based durability policy, you
              can require acknowledgment from:
          </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                      All replicas. That is, all of the replica nodes in
                      the replication group. Remember that your store has
                      more than one replication group, so the master node
                      is not waiting for acknowledgments from every machine
                      in the store.
                  </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                      No replicas. In this case, the master returns with
                      normal status from the write operation as soon as it
                      has met its synchronization-based durability policy.
                      These are described in the next section.

            <li>
              <p>
                      A simple majority of replicas. That is, if the
                      replication group has 5 replica nodes, then the
                      master will wait for acknowledgments from 3 nodes.
